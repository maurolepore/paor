## Submitting a Proposal

Please provide a 2 to 5 page proposal that describes the problem you want to solve. We expect submissions to include these components:

The Problem: What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should include a brief summary of existing work, such as R packages that may be relevant. If you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of support from a member of R Core.

The Plan: How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?

The Team: Who will work on the project. Briefly describe all participants, and the skills they will bring to the project.

Project Milestones: Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be required for each stage ( as payments will be tied to project milestone completion ). Each milestone should specify the work to be done and the expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to understand the scope of the project work.

How Can The ISC Help: Please describe how you think the ISC can help. If you are looking for a cash grant include a detailed itemised budget and spending plan. We expect that most of the budget will be allocated for labor costs, but we will consider funding travel, equipment and services, such as cloud computing resources with good justification. If you are seeking to start an ISC working group, then please describe the goals of the group and provide the name of the individual who will be committed to leading and managing the groupâ€™s activities. Also describe how you think the ISC can we help promote your project.

Dissemination: How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number of people? Please specify the open source or creative commons license(s) will you use, how you will host your code so that others can contribute, and how you will publicise your work. We encourage you to plan content to be shared quarterly on the  R Consortium blog.
